# Runtime Server Protocol Specification

The Runtime Server Protocol is based on version 3.x of the language server protocol.

## Base Protocol

The base protocol consists of a header and a content part (comparable to HTTP). The header and content part are
separated by a '\r\n'.

### Header Part

The header part consists of header fields. Each header field is comprised of a name and a value,
separated by ': ' (a colon and a space).
Each header field is terminated by '\r\n'.
Considering the last header field and the overall header itself are each terminated with '\r\n',
and that at least one header is mandatory, this means that two '\r\n' sequences always
immediately precede the content part of a message.

Currently the following header fields are supported:

| Header Field Name | Value Type  | Description |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------|
| Content-Length    | number      | The length of the content part in bytes. This header is required. |
| Content-Type      | string      | The mime type of the content part. Defaults to application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8 |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-responsive}

The header part is encoded using the 'ascii' encoding. This includes the '\r\n' separating the header and content part.

### Content Part

Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/) to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to `utf-8`, which is the only encoding supported right now.
Prior versions of the protocol used the string constant `utf8` which is not a correct encoding constant according to [specification](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml)). For backwards compatibility it is highly recommended that a client and a server treats the string `utf8` as `utf-8`.

### Example:

```
Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "server/getServerTypes",
	"params": {
		...
	}
}
```
### Base Protocol JSON structures

The following TypeScript definitions describe the base [JSON-RPC protocol](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):

#### Abstract Message

A general message as defined by JSON-RPC. The language server protocol always uses "2.0" as the jsonrpc version.

```typescript
interface Message {
	jsonrpc: string;
}
```
#### Request Message

A request message to describe a request between the client and the server. Every processed request must send a response back to the sender of the request.

```typescript
interface RequestMessage extends Message {

	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: number | string;

	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The method's params.
	 */
	params?: Array<any> | object;
}
```

#### Response Message

Response Message sent as a result of a request. If a request doesn't provide a result value the receiver of a request still needs to return a response message to conform to the JSON RPC specification. The result property of the ResponseMessage should be set to `null` in this case to signal a successful request.

```typescript
interface ResponseMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: number | string | null;

	/**
	 * The result of a request. This can be omitted in
	 * the case of an error.
	 */
	result?: any;

	/**
	 * The error object in case a request fails.
	 */
	error?: ResponseError<any>;
}

interface ResponseError<D> {
	/**
	 * A number indicating the error type that occurred.
	 */
	code: number;

	/**
	 * A string providing a short description of the error.
	 */
	message: string;

	/**
	 * A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional
	 * information about the error. Can be omitted.
	 */
	data?: D;
}

export namespace ErrorCodes {
	// Defined by JSON RPC
	export const ParseError: number = -32700;
	export const InvalidRequest: number = -32600;
	export const MethodNotFound: number = -32601;
	export const InvalidParams: number = -32602;
	export const InternalError: number = -32603;
	export const serverErrorStart: number = -32099;
	export const serverErrorEnd: number = -32000;
	export const ServerNotInitialized: number = -32002;
	export const UnknownErrorCode: number = -32001;

	// Defined by the protocol.
	export const RequestCancelled: number = -32800;
}
```
#### Notification Message

A notification message. A processed notification message must not send a response back. They work like events.

```typescript
interface NotificationMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The notification's params.
	 */
	params?: Array<any> | object;
}
```

#### $ Notifications and Requests

Notification and requests whose methods start with '$/' are messages which are protocol implementation dependent and might not be implementable in all clients or servers. For example if the server implementation uses a single threaded synchronous programming language then there is little a server can do to react to a '$/cancelRequest'. If a server or client receives notifications or requests starting with '$/' it is free to ignore them if they are unknown.

#### <a name="cancelRequest" class="anchor"></a> Cancellation Support (:arrow_right: :arrow_left:)

The base protocol offers support for request cancellation. To cancel a request, a notification message with the following properties is sent:

_Notification_:
* method: '$/cancelRequest'
* params: `CancelParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface CancelParams {
	/**
	 * The request id to cancel.
	 */
	id: number | string;
}
```

A request that got canceled still needs to return from the server and send a response back. It can not be left open / hanging. This is in line with the JSON RPC protocol that requires that every request sends a response back. In addition it allows for returning partial results on cancel. If the requests returns an error response on cancellation it is advised to set the error code to `ErrorCodes.RequestCancelled`.


## Runtime Server Protocol

The simple server protocol defines a set of JSON-RPC request, response and notification messages which are exchanged using the above base protocol. This section starts describing the basic JSON structures used in the protocol. The document uses TypeScript interfaces to describe these. Based on the basic JSON structures, the actual requests with their responses and the notifications are described.

In general, the simple server protocol supports JSON-RPC messages, however the base protocol defined here uses a convention such that the parameters passed to request/notification messages should be of `object` type (if passed at all). However, this does not disallow using `Array` parameter types in custom messages.

The protocol currently assumes that one server serves one tool. There is currently no support in the protocol to share one server between different tools. Such a sharing would require additional protocol to either lock a server to prevent concurrent changes to server state.
